Directory Traversal Attack (also known as Path Traversal) is a type of web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files 
and directories on a server that are outside the intended directory structure. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, 
such as configuration files, passwords, and other data.

How It Works:
Web applications often take user input to specify file paths for reading or displaying files. 
If the application does not properly validate or sanitize this input, an attacker can manipulate the file path to access restricted areas of the filesystem.

Example Scenario:
Let's consider a simple web application that allows users to view files based on a filename provided in the URL.

Vulnerable Application:
Imagine the URL to view a file looks like this:

http://example.com/viewfile.php?file=../../etc/passwd

The ../ sequences tell the server to go up one directory level. So, the application attempts to read the /etc/passwd file, which is a common file on 
Unix/Linux systems that contains user account information.
Attack Explanation:
Path Traversal: The ../ notation allows the attacker to navigate to parent directories. By chaining these together, the attacker can access files that 
are not directly accessible through the web application.
Unauthorized Access: If the application does not restrict access properly, the attacker could potentially read sensitive files and gain information about 
the server's configuration, users, or even passwords.
Prevention Measures:
To prevent Directory Traversal attacks, developers should implement the following security practices:

Input Validation: Always validate and sanitize user input to ensure it only contains allowed characters. For instance, restrict the file names to a specific 
format or a predefined list.
Use a Whitelist: Only allow access to specific files or directories. Maintain a whitelist of allowed files and check user input against it.
Limit File Permissions: Set proper file permissions on the server to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files.
Avoid Using User Input for File Paths: Where possible, avoid directly using user input to construct file paths. Instead, use safe methods for file access.
Conclusion:
Directory Traversal attacks can expose sensitive information and compromise the security of a web application. By understanding how these attacks work and 
implementing proper security measures, developers can significantly reduce the risk of such vulnerabilities in their applications.
